# Hallo, Hello, こにちは

Welcome to my profile! You might be wondering why I said hello in three different languages. That is because those are the languages I can speak. Those languages also tell something about me. While English is a language I grew up speaking, Japanese is not. Learning one of the hardest languages for English/Dutch native speakers is requires a few things such as persisting, dedication and curiosity.
